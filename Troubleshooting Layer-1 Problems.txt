-- Steps  to Resolution --

Step (1)
Reduce the load-interval of problematic interfaces
Clear interface counters and watch... is the problem still recurring?

Step (2)
Check speed and duplex settings
Check encapsulation settings

Step (3)
Move cable to an unused/different port on the router/switch
	- If problem persists continue troubleshooting
	- If problem stops you have a bad NIC/Interface on your router/switch
Swap cable for another one (possible bad cable)

Step (4)
Capture Sniffer Traces
	- Are malformed frames typically coming from the same Source MAC?
Check the lenght of the cable. Does it excees the maximum distance of 100 meters?
