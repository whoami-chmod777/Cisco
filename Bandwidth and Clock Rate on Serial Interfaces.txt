WAN serial links can run at a wide variety of speeds. To deal with the wide range of speeds,
routers physically slave themselves to the speed as dictated by the CSU/DSU through a process
called clocking. As a result, routers can use serial links without the need for additional
configuration or autonegotiation to sense the serial link’s speed. The CSU/DSU knows the
speed, the CSU/DSU sends clock pulses over the cable to the router, and the router reacts to
the clocking signal.

To make it work, the link uses two serial cables—
one a DTE cable and the other a DCE cable—which swap the transmit and receive pair on
the cables.
