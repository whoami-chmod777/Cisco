• Is the problem reported by only a single person, or a group of people

If a single person is the problem

• Only affecting a single destination or application
• Affecting all network access by that person


-- If the issue affects all network connectivity on a single device --

-- Physical Layer-1 on Device --

Identify and correct problems at Layer-1 on the Host device

• Is the host device powered-on
• Is your laptop plugged into the network cable
• Ensure Cable/DSL modem is powered-on and connected

Wireless (Wi-Fi)

• Is the Wi-Fi Radio switch turned on in your Laptop/Device
• Disabled NIC in Software
• Wrong Cable Type


-- Data Link Layer on Device --

• Wired Ethernet Duplex Issues
• WiFi SSID Incorrect


-- Physical Layer-1 on Switch --

• Is the Switch/Router powered-on 
• Is the Ethernet cable pushed in all the way (Broken clips) 
• Wrong Cable Type 
• Misaligned Network Modules
• Interfaces Administratively Disabled
• Interfaces Err-disabled
• Incorrectly-cabled Fiber
• Mismatched Ethernet Speed


-- Data Link Layer on Switch --

• PPPoE Authentication Errors
• Correct Encapsulation (Serial Interfaces)
• Router-On-A-Stick


- Router-On-A-Stick -

» When trunking from a Switch to a Router, subinterfaces are used 
» Each VLAN carried on the Trunk must have an associated subinterface
» A missing sub-interface would cause a Layer-2 issue
» Verifica>on Step-1: Iden>fy VLANs carried on VLAN Trunk link
» Verifica>on Step-2: Confirm each VLAN has associated sub-interface on router


-- Basic IOS Troubleshooting --

- Layer 1 -

show ip interface brief (Routers and Switches)
show interfaces fastEthernet 0/14

show logging | i err-disable
show logging | i fastEthernet 0/14

show interface status (Switches) 
show run interface <type/module>

show running-config


- Layer 2 -

show interfaces Virtual-Access 1
debug ppoe error
show running-config
show ip interface brief
show interface s0/0/0


- Router-On-A-Stick -

show interfaces trunk
